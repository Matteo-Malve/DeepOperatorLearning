# Deep Operator Learning

A talk for the Seminar "Scientific Machine Learning" \
Hosted by Tobias Buck at Ruprecht Karls Universit√§t Heidelberg

### Content
In this repo you will find:
- The slides of the talk, held on the 27th of November 2023
- The code presented to the audience as a test case
- A detailed report on the study of the subject

### Instructions to run the code
0. Clone the repository
1. Initialize submodules

        git submodule init
        git submodule update
2. Manually download v.0.11.2 of luluxvi/deepxde, rename the module to deepxde112

Note: I'm totally aware of the lack of professionality in this, but, as explained in Section Code of the report, this code has only didactic purposes and it was chosed to load some functions from the last realease of deepxde and some from an earlier one. It's unfortunately not possible to initialize two submodules of the same library at two different commits. Nor I want to breach copyrights by pushing the entire copy of the module in this repository.
